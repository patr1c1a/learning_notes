# Learning notes

I created this repository to start taking notes while reading books, articles or any text that teaches me something, or while watching talks on a topic I find interesting. I was inspired to do this by [Keyvan Akbary's repository](https://github.com/keyvanakbary/learning-notes).

This is just a personal notebook where I document my learning journey and not intended to be a complete summary of any of the sources. Also, sometimes I might just copy text from the source because I find there's no way I can say it better than the author (because of the learning purpose I pursue, I'll be typing by hand and not using copy-paste). Of course, if there is any sort of copyright problem, you can contact me and I'll remove any text I'm required to.
