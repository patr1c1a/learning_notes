# Learning notes

I created this repository to start taking notes while reading books, articles or any text that teaches me something, or while watching talks on a topic I find interesting.

This is just a personal notebook where I document my learning journey and not intended to be a complete summary of any of the sources.

I was inspired by [Keyvan Akbary's repository](https://github.com/keyvanakbary/learning-notes).
