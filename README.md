# Learning notes

I created this repository to start taking notes while reading books, articles or any text that teaches me something, or while watching talks on a topic I find interesting. I was inspired to do this by [Keyvan Akbary's repository](https://github.com/keyvanakbary/learning-notes).

This is just a personal notebook where I document my learning journey and not intended to be a complete summary of any of the sources. Also, sometimes I might just copy and paste text because I find there's no way I can say it better than the author. Of course, if there is a problem with this you can contact me and I'll remove any text that might be inconvenient.
