# Chapter 1: Clean Code

Bad code impedes programmers from doing a good job. The messier the code, the lower the productivity of the team. Management tends to add more staff but that's not the solution (new staff members are not familiar with the codebase).

Programmers know the technical details of what's being built so they should be helping other roles make informed decisions, instead of just submitting to the manager's deadlines. Keeping code clean at all times is the only way to meet deadlines.


###  What is clean code?

- **Bjarne Stroustrup:** clean code is focused and efficient, and does one thing well. Bad code is ambiguous.
- **Grady Booch:** code should be readable and contain only what is necessary.
- **"Big" Dave Thomas:** clean code allows to be enhanced by other people. It is minimal and has tests.
- **Michael Feathers:** clean code is made by someone who cares.
- **Ron Jeffries:** clean code has meaningful names and no duplication (one object or method should not do more than one thing).
- **Ward Cunningham:** clean code is obvious, simple and compelling. Each module tells you what comes next.

Writing clean code today makes it easier to write good code in the future. We need to be able to read and understand the surrounding code in order to write clean code.

We should always try to improve existing code, even if we make small ammends and modifications. Try to leave the existing code better than we found it.
