## Cloud concepts

*Cloud computing* is the practise of using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.

As opposed to *on premise*, where you own the servers, you pay for the IT team, rent and everything needed to get the hardware running, plus you have to manage risks.

### Evolution of cloud hosting

#### Dedicated server

In the past, you needed to host your website in a dedicated server, which is one physical machine running a single website. Even when it's expensive, it provides high security so for some specific cases.

#### Virtual private server

One physical machine that is divided into virtual sub-machines, that can run multiple websites. Good isolation and utilization of resources.

#### Shared hosting

One physical machine shared by many businesses, each one with a folder with permissions to use it. It's cheap but it can have isolation problems.

#### Cloud hosting

Distributed computing, where multiple physical machines function as one system, abstracted into multiple services. It's flexible, secure, scalable, low cost and highly configurable. Services can be chained together to create cloud architectures.

### Cloud Service Provider ("CSP") vs Cloud Platforms

A CSP is accessible through a single unified API, providing a CLI, an SDK and a mangement console. They can offer many cloud services to create a whole architecture, as well as provide metered billing to customize billing based on usage, built-in monitoring, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Some examples are AWS, GCP, Azure.

On the other hand, Cloud Platforms just offer multiple cloud services under a single UI but lack other features of a CSP. E.g.: HashiCorp, DataBricks, Twilio.

### CSP Tiers

- Top tier (tier 1): AWS, Azure, GCP, Alibaba Cloud.

- Mid tier (tier 2): IBM Cloud, Oracle Cloud (cheapest), Huawei Cloud, Tencent Cloud.

- Light tier (tier 3): Vultr, Digital Ocean, Akamai Connected Cloud (Linode).

- Private tier (tier 4): OpenStack (Rackspace), Apache CloudStack, Vmware vSphere. They can be installed in a organization's private datacenter to get IaaS solutions similar to functionality that top tier providers offer.

Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud: report about market trends.

### Common cloud services

Any CSP that has IaaS will always have 4 core service offerings:

- *Compute:* a virtual computer that can run applications, programs and code.
- *Networking:* internet connections or network isolations between services or outbound to the internet. And content delivery.
- *Storage:* virtual hard drive.
- *Databases:* virtual database.

In AWS: Compute can be done by EC2 virtual machines, networking can be done by VPC private cloud network, storage would be EBS virtual hard drives, and databases is RDS sql databases.

Other categories outside the main 4: analytics, application integration, AR & VR, AWS cost management, blockchain, business application, containers, customer engagement, developer tools, end user computing, game tech, internet of things, machine learning, management and governance, media services, migrations & transfer, mobile, quantum technologies, robotics, satellites, security identity and compliance.
